Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **18-carat**, a developer from Texas<!-- (save me) --> who likes to automate things and make people's jobs easier.
I currently work as Accessibility Team Lead for **Southeastern Oklahoma State University** and also maintain **CCAU**,
a userscript suite to automate some aspects of course copies in the Canvas LMS.

I have worked with the following languages:

- Bash
- Batch (when I was 14 lol)
- Gleam
- Haskell
- Python / Ren'Py
- Rust
- Swift
- TypeScript
