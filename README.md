Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **18-carat**, a developer from Texas<!-- (as of 2025; if you're reading this in 2026, I will be a refugee up north, God willing) --> who likes to automate things and make people's jobs easier.
I currently work for **Southeastern Oklahoma State University** and contract out to **Murray State College**. 
My specialties are *automation*, *QA testing*, *accessibility*, and *low-level programming*.

I have worked with the following languages and frameworks:

- Rust <3
- Swift
- Selenium
- Gleam
- TypeScript
- Python / Ren'Py
