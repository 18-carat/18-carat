Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **18-carat**, a developer from Texas<!-- as of 2025. If you're reading this in 2026, I will be a refugee up north, God willing --> who likes to automate things and make people's jobs easier.
I currently work for **Southeastern Oklahoma State University** and contract out to **Murray State College**. 
My specialties are *automation*, *low-level programming*, and *accessibility*.

I have worked with the following languages and frameworks:

- Rust
- TypeScript
- Swift
- Selenium
- Gleam
- Python
